## Description

This is a site for checking the price and history of whiskies available in the alko site. The code could be somewhat easily be updated to include other products too or additional sites.

<br>
Functionality it includes is:
<ul>
    <li>databasing functionality for storing userdata and the Alko product prices (as they don't keep their price history available)</li>
    <li>automated data collection from an API</li>
    <li>requesting data from backend to frontend, and posting data vice verse </li>
    <li>chart drawing functionality using the collected data</li>
    <li>and other basic front-/backend functionality + middleware that fullstack applications require</li>
</ul>
